              My sacrifice of not going abroad and staying in Pakistan to do
              something good with this country resulted in formation of
              Studentsâ€™ Zone. I feel very privileged to be the CEO of this
              amazing institute working tirelessly on this nation's kids and
              furnishing them to become leaders of tomorrow. I feel so honored
              when I see how my dream is living and breathing everyday when
              these gems secure highest positions in AKU-EB federal board. My
              aim is to provide this nation with pioneers of future; Leaders of
              our country with great academics, amazing ethics, empathy,
              mental/physical strength and remarkable challenge accepting
              capabilities and my institute along with the efforts of my faculty
              is successfully achieving these milestone.
